# CareLink PHC: Operational Training Manual
## Standard Operating Procedures for Field Pilots

### 1. Introduction for Health Workers
Welcome to CareLink PHC. This system is designed to reduce your paperwork and ensure every patient in your facility receives the highest quality of care.

### 2. Daily Clinical Workflows
#### 2.1 Patient Registration
1.  **Search First**: Always use the "Fuzzy Search" on the Patients tab to check if the patient is already registered.
2.  **Unique ID**: Every patient is assigned a unique system ID. If they don't have one, create a "New Patient" entry.
3.  **Vitals**: Ensure BP, Weight, and Temperature are recorded at every encounter.

#### 2.2 Outpatient (OPD) & Clinics
-   Select the appropriate service type (OPD, ANC, IMM, or NCD).
-   The system will automatically calculate the required indicators for the end-of-month NHMIS report.

#### 2.3 Lab & Diagnostics
-   When a clinician orders a test, it appears in the **Diagnostic Lab** dashboard.
-   Lab technicians should record the result and click **Verify**.

#### 2.4 Pharmacy & Stock
-   Pharmacists can view pending prescriptions.
-   Click **Fulfill** to dispense medication and automatically update the facility stock level.

### 3. Managerial Oversight
Facility managers can use the **Analytics Dashboard** to view:
-   **OPD Trends**: Are we seeing more malaria cases than last week?
-   **ANC Coverage**: How many pregnant women are completing their 4th visit?
-   **Stock Alerts**: Which drugs are running low?

### 4. Offline Resilience
If the internet goes out:
-   **Continue working**. The system will save all data locally on your device.
-   When the green "System Online" light appears in the sidebar, the data will automatically sync to the state server.
