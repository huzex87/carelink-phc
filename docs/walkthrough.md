## 🏛️ Comprehensive Phase Accomplishments

### Phase 1 & 2: Clinical Core & Intelligence
- **Module Suite**: Full EHR modules for OPD, ANC, Immunization, NCD, Lab, and Pharmacy.
- **Indicator Engine**: Automated NHMIS reporting with sub-second processing.
- **Dashboards**: High-fidelity executive oversight for facility and LGA managers.

### Phase 3 & 4: Security & Operational Scaling
- **Military-Grade Security**: AES-256 encryption, centralized audit logs, and rate-limiting.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated quality and clinical safety verification.
- **Field Readiness**: Comprehensive [Operational Training Manual](https://github.com/huzex87/carelink-phc/blob/main/docs/TRAINING_MANUAL.md) for health workers.

### Phase 5: Intelligence & Extended Ecosystem
- **Epidemic Alerting**: Statistical anomaly detection ("ML-lite") to identify disease outbreaks (e.g., Malaria/Cholera spikes).
- **Digital Referral Chain**: Formalized inter-facility coordination with digital handover protocols.
- **Institutional SSO**: OIDC/JWT federated identity integration for state-wide access management.
