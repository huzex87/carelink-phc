## 🏗️ The 12-Phase Journey to Excellence

### 1-3: Core Foundation & Hardening

- **Clinical EHR**: OPD, ANC, IMM, and NCD modules aligned with NHMIS 2023+ standards.
- **Offline-First Resilience**: Bi-directional Pouch-Couch synchronization for rural continuity.
- **Security Hardening**: Audit logging, rate limiting, and Helmet-secured API layers.

### 4-6: Scale & Infrastructure

- **Logistics Integration**: Integrated Pharmacy and Lab modules with AMC (Average Monthly Consumption) tracking.
- **CI/CD Excellence**: Automated pipelines via GitHub Actions for rigorous clinical validation.
- **Dockerized Resilience**: Container-orchestrated production environment with Nginx SSL termination.

### 7-9: Intelligence & Community Extension

- **Logistics (LMIS)**: Automated drug reordering based on clinical prescription velocity.
- **GIS Intelligence**: Disease cluster heatmapping and resource distribution analytics.
- **CHV Mobile Hub**: Offline-first mobile tools for Community Health Volunteers.

### 10-12: Cloud Scale & Proactive Care

- **Cloud-Native (Vercel)**: Production deployment with serverless adapters for global scale.
- **AI Forecasting**: Predictive stock-out modeling and epidemic spike detection.
- **NEWS2 Alerts**: Real-time clinical risk alerting integrated into the EHR workflow.
