## 🏛️ Phase 8 & 9 Milestone Accomplishments

### 1. GIS Intelligence & Community Outreach (Phase 8)
- **GIS Intelligence Hub**: Real-time spatial heatmapping for morbidity patterns vs. clinical resource distribution.
- **CHV Mobile Hub**: Offline-first mobile tools for field volunteers to conduct household census, screenings, and referrals.
- **Spatial Patient Model**: Geolocation tagging for precise epidemiological containment.

### 2. CI/CD Stability & Security (Phase 9)
- **Security Remediation**: Scrubbed actual-looking credentials from configuration files following GitGuardian alerts.
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Initialized monorepo lock files and optimized GitHub Actions for reliable clinical builds.
