# CareLink PHC: Final Project Walkthrough
## Comprehensive Digital Health Infrastructure Delivery

I have successfully implemented all four phases of the CareLink PHC system, delivering a "World Class" production-ready Digital Health solution.

## Phase 4 Completion: Operationalization & Scale
The final phase focused on preparing the system for state-wide deployment and enterprise stability.

### 1. Operational Excellence
- **CI/CD Automation**: Integrated **GitHub Actions** to automate code verification and clinical safety checks on every push.
- **Modular Architecture**: Refactored the backend into a modular service-oriented structure for easier scaling.

### 2. Specialized Clinical Modules
- **Diagnostic Lab**: Dedicated interface for ordering tests (Malaria RDT, Hb, etc.) and verifying results.
- **Pharmacy & Inventory**: Full medication stock tracking and automated prescription fulfillment with "Critical Stock" alerts.

### 3. Field Readiness
- **[Training Manual](https://github.com/huzex87/carelink-phc/blob/main/docs/TRAINING_MANUAL.md)**: Authored a comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for health facility staff and managers.
