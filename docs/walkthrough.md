## 🏛️ Phase 7 Milestone Accomplishments

### 1. Integrated Logistics (LMIS)
- **Automated Stock Sync**: The system now automatically decrements inventory levels when prescriptions are dispensed in the clinic.
- **Consumption Analytics**: Real-time calculation of **Average Monthly Consumption (AMC)** to prevent facility stock-outs.
- **Stock-Out Alerts**: Critical threshold notifications in the Alert Center for low medicine quantities.

### 2. Longitudinal Clinical Timeline
- **Unified Care History**: A world-class visual timeline for clinicians, aggregating OPD visits, Lab results, Pharmacy dispensing, and Referrals.
- **Data Continuity**: Ensures health workers have immediate context on a patient's historical treatments across different modules.
